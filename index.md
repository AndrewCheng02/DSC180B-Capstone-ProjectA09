## Applications of Connectivity in the Human Brain Using Functional MRI data: Classification with Graph Neural Networks

**Abstract**

In our project, we implement a neural network-based application to discern
gender difference from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting
state data. An important region that activates while the brain is at rest is the
default mode network (DMN). While we donâ€™t directly measure the activation
of the DMN, it proves to be a key differentiator for the classification problem.
Our research will walk through steps of statistical methods, simulation, and
model description to achieve our task.
